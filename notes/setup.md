# React Native Setup Guide

This guide walks through how to set up your machine to develop a React Native app.

The tl;dr is:

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- Install the [Expo mobile app](https://expo.io/) on your device
- Install [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app)
- Use Create React Native App to scaffold and start a new app
- Open Expo and scan the QR code to reveal your new app.

## Install node.js

The first thing to do is to ensure that you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. At the time of writing, node 8 is the latest stable release, and is recommended.

If you don't have node installed, [head over to the download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download and install a copy.

## Install yarn

React Native supports both npm4 and yarn. Node 8, however, ships with npm5 - this is currently unsupported. To get around this, we'll use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), which is generally faster and more reliable than any version of npm.

To install yarn, [go to the download page](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and find the installation instructions for your OS.

## Install Google Chrome

In order to connect to your app for debugging purposes, you need to install Google Chrome from [the download page](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/).

## Install the Expo mobile app

The Expo mobile app allows you to connect to and view your app on your mobile device, whilst it is being developed on your local machine. To install it, go to the App Store or Google Play Store on your device, and search for 'Expo'. If you are reading this on your mobile device, use these links to install the [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) apps respectively.

## Install Create React Native App

[Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) is the easiest way to start building a new React Native application. It allows you to start a project without installing or configuring any tools to build native code.

Install it with npm:

``` bash
npm install -g create-react-native-app
```

All being well, you should now have installed everything you need to get started.

## Scaffold and run an app

On your local machine, open a terminal window.

Run:

``` bash
create-react-native-app my-sample-app
```

Create React Native App should busy itself by creating your app's development workspace, and installing all dependencies with yarn.

Once it is done, run:

``` bash
cd my-sample-app
yarn start
```

Wait a couple of minutes for the server to start, and then you should see a QR code presented in the terminal.

Open the Expo app on your mobile device, and scan the QR code. The newly scaffolded app should open on your device.

## Troubleshooting

### Expo app can't connect to development server

- Ensure your computer and device are on the same network.
- If you are on Windows, and have VirtualBox or VMWare installed, `yarn start` might not work properly. [Follow these instructions to solve](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/issues/60#issuecomment-317104728).
